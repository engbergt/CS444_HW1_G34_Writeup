\section*{Write Up}
Group 34 commands used, flag definitions and question answers.

\paragraph{Outline}

\begin{itemize}
  \item A log of commands used to perform the requested actions, as well as a write-up of your concurrency solution.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item (in linux-yocto...) \texttt{make menuconfig}
    \item (in menuconfig) \texttt{General setup->local version = yocto-standardg34hw1}
    \item saved output as \texttt{.config}
    \item (in linux-yocto...) \texttt{make -j4 all}
    \item \texttt{source envivronment-setup-i586-poky-linux.csh}
    \item \texttt{qemu-system-i386 -gdb tcp::5534 -S -nographic -kernel linux-yocto-3.19/arch/x86/boot/bzImage -drive file=core-image-lsb-sdk-qemux86.ext4,if=virtio -enable-kvm -net none -usb -localtime --no-reboot --append "root=/dev/vda rw console=ttyS0 debug".}
    \item (in another shell from linux-yocto-3.19) \texttt{gdb -tui vmlinux}
    \item (in gdb) \texttt{target remote :5534}
    \item \texttt{continue}
    \item \texttt{uname=root}
    \item \texttt{uname -r outputs yocto-standardg34hw1 and kernel-version is confirmed}

  \end{itemize}
  \item An explanation of each and every flag in the listed qemu command-line
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{-gdb tcp:5534} allows qemu to be used with a debugger on port 5534
    \item \texttt{-S} keeps the CPU from running at startup
    \item \texttt{-nographic} disables qemu's graphical output
    \item \texttt{-kernel} tells qemu to use the given kernel image
    \item \texttt{-drive} defines a new drive
    \item \texttt{-enable-kvm} starts qemu in kernel virtual machine
    \item \texttt{-net none} tells qemu that no network devices should be configured
    \item \texttt{-usb} enables the USB driver
    \item \texttt{-localtime} to start at the current local time
    \item \texttt{--no-reboot} tells qemu to exit rather than rebooting
    \item \texttt{-append} indicates the command line to use
  \end{itemize}
  \item The main purpose of this assignment was to get the Yocto version of Linux running in a Virtual Machine on the OS2 server.
  \item The way we ensured that our solution was correct was to run Yocto and view shell output to verify it was running.
  \item We learned how to run Yocto in qemu on OS2.
  \item Version control log (formatted as a table)
